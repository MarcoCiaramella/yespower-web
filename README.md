Start monetizing your website with lightweight crypto mining.
## Why mining
Cryptos have a place in the website monetization. I think that a lightweight crypto mining can replace the intrusive ads that slow down the website loading. Mining is silent and transparent for the user. It works in background and keeps the website loading fast.
## WARNING
This library brings "authorized" crypto mining on your website. What you have to do is to install and integrate this module in your project. Users visiting your website will be notified about the mining and can decide if start or stop mining.
A good practice is to disable ads if user decide to keep mining improving user experience.
## Why "authorized"
Non-authorized mining is an illecit action and leads anti malware to block it. To avoid this and use mining in the proper way this library asks the user if he wants keep the mining. This behavior can not be changed from library's client.
