Start monetizing your website with lightweight crypto mining.
## Why mining
Cryptos have a place in the website monetization. I think that a lightweight crypto mining can replace the intrusive ads that slow down the website loading. Mining is silent and transparent for the user. It works in background and keeps the website loading fast.
## Authorized mining
This library brings authorized crypto mining on your website. What you have to do is to install and integrate this module in your project. Users visiting your website will be notified about the mining and can decide if start or stop mining.
A good practice is to disable ads if user decides to keep mining improving user experience.
## Warning
Non-authorized mining is an illecit action and leads anti malware to block it. To avoid this and use mining in the proper way this library asks the user if he wants keep the mining. This is why I discourage you to modify this behavior in the source code. If you want keep mining monetization please use this module as is.
## Yespower
The implemented miner uses [yespower](https://www.openwall.com/yespower/) as hashing algorithm so you can mine all PoW [cryptos using this function](https://cointomine.today/algorithm/yespower/). Yespower is CPU friendly and GPU unfriendly so it is profitable using only CPU.
